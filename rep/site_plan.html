    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>There is a certain vibe to hardcover books, a feeling that every book reader enjoys. With epdfs and online
      libraries where the books can be acquired cheaply, we are missing the experience which comes only on paper. I want
      to revitalize that very experience.
      My website is a communication site where patrons can giveaway the books that they donâ€™t need, and others can
      acquire them at a price as low as the shipping cost.
      We act as the mediator of transaction, the reviewer of books, and maintainer of anonymity.

      <h4>Stormlight Archive</h4>
    <p>
      This book was a little bit boring at the beginning. The visualization that came to mind was too flashy, but I got used to it by the half of the first book and after that it went really smoothed. Like any other Sci-fi, it has a hero/multiple heroes, their journey, some friends to help him, some time to pass in darkness and a glimmer of light that kept him sane. In that point of view, it is not much different.
      However, it has really good character development and you start loving almost every character. Other than one character, which is depicted as most
      honorable character there could ever be, all the other characters have multiple faces which develops love and hatred towards them with the situation.
      I think it has perfectly interpreted the gray line of morality and the dilemma. 
      It has complicated feelings of teen love and fatherly love and expectations. It has social justice, differences, and inequalities along with 
      proper explanation for each practice. 
      The theological aspect is well developed and even though there are some shadows of writer's Mormon upbringing, the lead characters are atheist/secular which makes it easier to read and establish.
      I think it is a good book for early teens as there is complex social system and plot but there are no deep sexual interpretations.

    <h4>A Song of Ice and Fire</h4>
    <p>A classic epic made for modern world. It is a spectacular literary masterpiece which is really good in every aspect other than being complete.
      Great cover, elaborative exploration of imaginary world. Well connected and practical anecdotes and finally, awesome representation of modern world.
      It is what we love and we dread, we abhor and we seek. It has everything a reader would ever look for and everything a reader would expect not to like.
      It shows the hard truths of life along with the ideals we should follow. It treats teenagers as teenagers who are very well capable of making bad decisions 
      even when they are the lead characters. It shows love, compassion, hatred and fear. It decipts morality, ethics and ambitions.
      It slaps in the face of humanity by showing them thier life as it is. 
      It may have used magic and dragons and this blood and that blood, but it has played with the very soul/stain of mankind, the lust in really admirable manner.
