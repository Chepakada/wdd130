    <p>Hi, My name is Prashant Lamichhane. For those who have hard time calling my name, you can call me with any name you want. 
        I am planning on majoring on Computer Science. I love to watch a lot of TV. Read fantacy novels and eat along with cooking.
        I am not married.  I am a full time student.
        I love almost everything about BYU-Idaho. But the top of the list goes to affordability. I am here for BS.
        I see a lot of money and future in Web degisn design but I don't think I belong there. I am taking this course because it is a basic requirement for my major.
        I hope to be able to analyse the work done by others and be able to take the most out of it and incase the life doesn't go as I wish, I may have some place to hold on to.
        I have been a member of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for almost 5 months now.
        <br><i><b>Smile just a little more.</b></i>
